"""Tests for ``PIIReadLoggingMixin``.

The mixin is mounted on three viewsets — ``MemberViewSet``,
``BillingProfileViewSet``, ``ResellerViewSet`` — and emits one
structured ``pii.read`` line per successful ``.retrieve()``.

What we lock here:

  * Fires on ``GET /api/commissioning/members/<pk>/`` (the
    canonical detail endpoint).
  * Does NOT fire on ``GET /api/commissioning/members/`` (list).
  * Does NOT fire on 404 — if the office didn't see the PII, no
    audit row.
  * Does NOT fire on 403 — same reason.
  * The line carries the actor email, subject_kind
    (``app.model``), subject_id, tenant schema, and client IP.

The other two viewsets are exercised by a parametrized smoke test
that just asserts a single ``pii.read`` line lands on retrieve;
each viewset's specific permission semantics are locked in their
own tests elsewhere.
